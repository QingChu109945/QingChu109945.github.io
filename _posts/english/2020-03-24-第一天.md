    The picture tells us that nothing can be compared with creation or innovation when it comes to the cultivation of individual characteristics. Put it another way, the adventure spirit is a key ingredient of the modern recipe to success, either for individuals or for a nation. A great example of benefits concerning perseverance would be the success story of Jack Ma.

  第三段的写作方略：

  版本一
  
  
    所以，毫无疑问，还能找岀很多像乔布斯，马斯克，扎克伯克这样的例子，但是他们己 经足以说明创新加上持续的努力是在任何领域中取得成功的根本品质。一个想要拥抱辉煌未 来的年轻人必须毫不犹豫的付岀时间和努力！他必须足够积极和勇敢，能为了长期的成功付 岀短期的牺牲。将来己经到来。它始于现在。
Instances like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Mark Elliot Zuckerberg could be easily multiplied, but these will suffice to show that  	is essential to our success. Finally, a youngster who aspires to embrace the glorious future must commit the time and energy without any hesitation.


  版本二

    第一句：
    The picture, to some degree, makes us reflect the conventional success and enlightens us to wonder the meaning of life and its permanent spiritual values. The spirit of indeDendence is widely acknowledged as the essential trait that will entitle us not only the material wealth but also the way to make life meaningful. So, the surest way to have a meaningful, happy life is to commit ourselves to striving for a decent and desirable goal with the guidance this quality.
    从某种程度上讲，这幅图画使我们去反思传统的成功，启发我们去探究生命的意义和那 些永恒的精神价值。独立的精神是一种必须的品质，能使我们不仅可以获得物质财富和权力， 还能让我们找到使生命更有意义的道路。所以获得幸福和充满意义的生活的最可靠的方式在 这种精神的伴随下，为了一个值得的目标，自己不断地努力。
    
  版本三：
    
    To a large extent, we are compelled by this drawing to argue that success usually begins with one's state of mind or one's determination. And the merit discussed above is essential for us to embark on the journey to personal success and to arrive at our lofty destination. From my personal perspective, to overlook the importance of self-reliance will inflict great losses on our personal improvement, as it does serve as the irreplaceable element in the formula for individual sun ival and success.
    很大程度上，这幅图画使我们认为成功往往开始于一个人的思维状态和他的决心。以上 所讨论的品质对于我们开始成功之路和抵达更高终点而言是非常必要的。从我个人的角度讲, 忽略了自立的重要性对于我们的个人进步而言将会造成巨大的损失。因为这种品质在我们个 人成长和成功的公式中充当着必不可少的因素。
    
  版本四：

    We are inspired by the picture to explore the real essence of perseverance and persistence. It enables us to transform our aspirations from a state of potentiality into one of reality. If we are determined to achieve our success, we may learn from these illuminating words: "Great works are performed not by strength, but by perseverance. ”
    我们受到这幅图画的启发去探究坚持的真正意义。这幅图画让我们渴望从一种可能的状 态变成现实。如果我们决定达到成功，我们就应该知道：完成伟大的事业不在于体力，而在 于坚韧不拔的毅力。
    
    
  版本五：

    Just as Bertrand Russell put it, " Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the sufFering of mankind." So, the surest way to have a meaningful, happy life is to commit ourselves to striving for a decent and desirable goal with the guidance this quality.
    正如罗素所说的那样：对爱情的渴望，对知识的追求，对人类苦难不可遏制的同情，是 支配我一生的单纯而强烈的三种感情。所以，获得有意义的和快乐人生的最确定之路是在这 种素质的引导之下为了体面和正面的目标而努力。
    
  版本六：

    第一句：
    任何能真正获得幸福的人都必须具有这种精神，这种精神不仅能产生物质财富和一般意 义的成功，而且能让我们获得真正的有意义的人生。
    第二句：
    所以找到一个对自己和对这个世界都重要的目标能帮我们找到一条通往成功的确定之 路，我们不断努力，我们就能最终到达幸福的终点站。
16.So, doubtless, setting goals mattering both to ourselves and others will help us find the most reliable way to gain happy life and our continuous devotion to the goal will definitely bring us to the tenninal of happiness.
